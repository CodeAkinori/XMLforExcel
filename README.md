# XML to Excel Converter NF Examples!
### This Python script is designed to convert XML files containing Nota Fiscal (NF) data into an Excel spreadsheet. The script utilizes the xmltodict library to parse the XML files and extract the relevant information, and the pandas library to create and export the data to an Excel file.

### Dependencies

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. To install the required dependencies, use the following commands:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

The script will read the XML files one by one, extract the NF information, and create a Pandas data frame.
The data frame will be exported to an Excel file named "NotasFiscais.xlsx" in the project directory.
